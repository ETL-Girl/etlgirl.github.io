I"™3<p>Data Science is all about gathering findings from data. It‚Äôs about uncovering hidden information that can allow businesses to make better decisions. Its task is to <strong>translate business question into question answerable using available data</strong>. Today data is everywhere. And it‚Äôs incredibly valuable.</p>

<h1 id="so-what-exactly-can-data-do">So what exactly can data do?</h1>

<p>Data can be used to <strong>describe the state of an organization or a process</strong> at a given time using reporting like dashboards or alerts. It can be used to <strong>determine the cause of events and behaviors</strong> - with data science techniques we can examine not only correlation between events but also complex causal relationships. Finally, machine learning models can help in <strong>predicting outcomes of future events</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="the-data-science-workflow">The Data Science workflow</h1>

<p>Every data science project starts with <strong>data collection</strong>. Data collection methods can be divided into primary and secondary. <strong>Secondary data</strong> are all the data that have already been gathered and can be obtained from existing sources. <strong>Primary data</strong> are the data that are yet to be collected either through <strong>qualitative or quantitative collection methods</strong>. Qualitative methods include all kinds of non-quantifiable data such as feelings, words, emotions and are gathered through interviews, surveys, focus groups and so on. Quantitative data can be represented mathematically and various kinds of numeric methods can be applied on them.</p>

<p>Next step in the workflow is <strong>data visualization and exploration</strong>. It involves building dashboards for visual inspection of data over time or for comparison of different datasets.</p>

<p>Finally, appropriately processed data is used for <strong>making future predictions</strong>. This stage is when actual machine learning models are created.</p>

<p>On each stage of data science workflow various OKRs (Objective/Key Result) may appear. To present an example:</p>

<p><strong>Data collection objective</strong>: Improve Data Warehousing</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>KR 1: Limit the time needed to import data from external source to 12h</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>KR 2: Decrease the number of reported data import errors by implementing automatic tests</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Visualization &amp; Exploration objective</strong>: Make Company Results Reporting Transparent</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>KR 1: Build a Tableau dashboard showing monthly revenues and losses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>KR 2: Prepare an automatic newsletter tracking monthly revenues and losses</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Prediction model objective</strong>: Increase Revenue from Key Client</p>

<ul>
  <li>KR 1: Implement a linear regression model to estimate the value of Key Client purchases based on historical data</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="applications-of-data-science">Applications of Data Science</h1>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-07-09-smartwatch.jpg" width="100%" /></p>

<p>There are three main areas where data science is used. <strong>Traditional machine learning</strong> models can be used to detect fraudulent transactions on credit cards, predict customer churn, categorize potential customers into groups to adjust purchase recommendation and so on.</p>

<p>Another category is so-called <strong>Internet of Things (IoT)</strong>, which in general means gadgets not being standard computers but still having the ability to transmit data - e.g. smart watch monitoring physical activity, home automation devices (like lighting, air conditioning, security systems) or voice control home assistance.</p>

<p>Lastly, <strong>deep learning</strong> is used to draw conclusions from huge amounts of data (which couldn‚Äôt be processed by traditional machine learning algorithms) thanks to implementation of multiple layers of mini-algorithms (‚Äúneurons‚Äù). Such models are used for example in image recognition for autonomous driving systems.</p>

<p>Data engineers are mainly responsible for building <strong>architectures for data storage and processing</strong>. They form the first step in data science workflow by extracting data from available sources and piping it somewhere for the analysts to use. Common data sources are websites, customer data, logistics data and financial transactions. Often engineers also do transformations so that the data is <em>clean</em> and easy to analyze. They might be responsible for so-called <strong>data pseudonymization</strong> - a process in which personally identifiable information (PII, one of especially sensitive kinds of data) is replaced by artificial identifier and access to information is restricted only to neccessary groups.</p>

<h3 id="external-data-sources">External Data Sources</h3>
<p>Other popular data sources are <strong>APIs, public records and mechanical turk</strong>. Using an API (<strong>Application Programming Interface</strong>) is an easy way to request data from a third party. Some well-known APIs include <em>Twitter, Wikipedia, Yahoo! Finance</em> and <em>Google Maps</em>. <strong>Public data</strong> are generally gathered and shared by public institutions and consist of information related to health, economics, demographic statistics, etc. <strong>Mechanical Turk (MTurk)</strong> is an outsourcing of simple data validation tasks to a big group of people (or a crowd, which results in the term <em>crowdsourcing</em>). The aim is to obtain a big enough labeled or otherwise validated dataset to be used as input in machine learning algorithms. There are many platforms offering to recruit workers for these tasks, such as <em>AWS MTurk</em>.</p>

<h3 id="data-storage-systems">Data Storage Systems</h3>

<p>In general businesses generate more data that can be stored on a single computer. In such case <strong>parallel storage solutions</strong> are used - data is stored accross many different computers. A company might have its own set of storage computers called a <strong>cluster</strong> or a <strong>server</strong> on its premises or it can use storage services of another company, which is referred to as <strong>cloud storage</strong>. Commmon cloud services providers include <em>Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS)</em> and <em>Google Cloud</em>.</p>

<p>Different types of data require different storage solutions and have their own query languages. <strong>Tabular data</strong> (a type of data that can be expressed as a set of rows and columns) can be stored in a <strong>relational database</strong> and <strong>SQL (Structured Query Language)</strong> is used to gain access to them. <strong>Unstructured data</strong>, like text, image, video and audio files, are stored in a <strong>document database</strong>. Querying such databases is done mainly through <strong>NoSQL (Not Only SQL)</strong>.</p>

<p>Data analysts describe the data through <strong>statistical analysis, hypothesis tests and visualization</strong>. They use existing data storage platforms, developed by data engineers, to analyze and summarize data. Oftentimes they will be responsible for creating <strong>dashboards</strong> using Business Intelligence (BI) tools.</p>

<h3 id="dashboards">Dashboards</h3>

<p>Dashboards are a visual set of metrics updating either in real time or on a fixed schedule. These may include time series plots, bar charts for categorical comparison, single number highlight (such as a number of visitors on a website) and many others. Usually tables and big chunks of text are avoided. Among tools used for building dashboards we will find spreadsheets like <strong>Excel or Google Sheets</strong>, BI Tools such as <strong>Power BI, Tableau, Looker</strong> or more sophisticated, customized tools like <strong>R Shiny</strong> and <strong>d3.js</strong>. Same dashboard should be implemented accross the whole organization (or at least for a specific project) to improve consistency and readability.</p>

<h3 id="ad-hoc-requests">Ad-Hoc Requests</h3>

<p>Analysts might sometimes be asked an <strong>ad-hoc request</strong> - a request which is not repeated periodically, but is rather an unpredictable initiative from other departments. Proper request should be specific and provide the context so that an analyst is able to spot and recommend which data to use. It additionally should have a priority and a due date. A good practice for managing ad-hoc requests is to implement a ticketing system like <strong>Trello</strong>, <strong>JIRA</strong> or <strong>Asana</strong> where customers will be able to raise a request with all mentioned details. Then the requests are internally assigned to the members of data analytics team.</p>

<h3 id="ab-testing">A/B Testing</h3>

<p>A/B testing is a type of a randomized experiment for determining which of two options (A or B) is more popular with clients. It usually concerns changes on a website, addition of new features in an app, various e-mail marketing campaigns etc.  Running an A/B test consists of four steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pick a metric to track, e.g. number of clicks on a website,</li>
  <li>calculate sample size - larger sample size will allow to detect smaller differences between options,</li>
  <li>execute the experiment,</li>
  <li>check for statistical significance - this will tell if the difference between two options is meaningful (i.e. it represents an actual difference in tastes and is not just caused by random chance).</li>
</ul>

<p>Machine learning analysis is used to extrapolate what is likely to happen based on what is already known from historical data. ML scientists use training data for <strong>predicting outcomes of events, classification, image processing, automated text analysis and so on</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="supervised-vs-unsupervised-machine-learning">Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning</h2>

<p><strong>Supervised learning</strong> is a subset of ML models where data have <strong>features</strong> and <strong>labels</strong>. Examples of use of such models are recommendation systems or churn prediction. <strong>Features</strong> (or <strong>variables</strong>, <strong>attributes</strong>) are various characteristics of each observation in a dataset (e.g. age, gender, income). <strong>Labels</strong> are quantities that the model will predict (e.g. whether or not the customer will churn) based on features.</p>

<p>Another group of ML algorithms are <strong>unsupervised learning</strong> methods. For example <strong>clustering</strong> divides data into groups by finding some patterns within a dataset. Examples of use include customer segmentation, image segmentation or anomaly detection. Contrary to supervised learning models, clustering uses features but doesn‚Äôt use labels.</p>

<p><strong>Model evaluation</strong> is an important part of building an ML solution. Only a part of a dataset is used for training the model and the remaining part is used for testing its goodness.</p>

<h2 id="natural-language-processing">Natural Language Processing</h2>

<p>Natural Language Processing (<strong>NLP</strong>) in general is any ML problem where the dataset is in form of a text (e.g. reviews, e-mail subjects, tweets). Possible uses include classifying sentiment (positive or negative emotion expressed in a text) of reviews or clustering medical records with similar pathologies. To make a successful NLP model, the text has usually to be divided into separate words and then their sentiment is checked. To account for synonyms <strong>word embedding</strong> is used - a method which groups together similar words.</p>

<h2 id="deep-learning">Deep Learning</h2>

<p><strong>Deep Learning</strong> (or <strong>Neural Networks</strong>, <strong>Neural Nets</strong>) is a special area of ML models requiring much more data but able to solve way more complex problems. Although predictions might be very accurate, it often might be hard for humans to understand why the model predicted one outcome and not another. An area of models where the prediction is understandable is called an <strong>explainable AI</strong> (where AI stands for Artificial Intelligence). Such models give not only prediction but also an explanation why this particular prediction was made.</p>

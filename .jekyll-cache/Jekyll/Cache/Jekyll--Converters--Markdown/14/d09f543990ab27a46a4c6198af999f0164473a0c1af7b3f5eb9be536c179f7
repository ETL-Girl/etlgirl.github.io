I"XW<p>The first step in every statistical analysis is determining whether the data we are dealing with is <strong>a population</strong> or <strong>a sample</strong>. A population is the entire set of all possible data values that are of interest in a study we perform. It is usually denoted by capital letter <strong>N</strong>. A sample is a subset of a population usually denoted by letter <strong>n</strong>. Most of the time obtaining the whole population data is either impossible or would be extremely hard or expensive. Let’s say we want to gather data about students of a specific city or a country. To get <strong>population data</strong>, we would need to contact <strong>all students</strong> on university campuses, all studying at home, all on exchange, all part-time students and so on. Instead, we can draw a <strong>sample data</strong> which means we just contact <strong>randomly selected students</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> are numbers (more formally: <strong>coefficients</strong>) used for a summary of <strong>available data</strong>. Together with data visualization they form the basis of data analysis. We already know that available data usually means a sample. These numbers, obtained using a sample, are called <strong>statistics</strong> (the numbers based on the entire population are called <strong>parameters</strong>).</p>

<p>We also have to distinguish descriptive statistics from <strong>inferential statistics</strong>. The latter are used to <strong>draw conclusions</strong> about the whole population based on its sample.</p>

<h1 id="types-of-data">Types of Data</h1>

<p>Having a good understanding of data types is crucial for choosing optimal statistics and visualization methods. At the highest level data can be divided into <strong>qualitative (categorical)</strong> and <strong>quantitative (numerical)</strong>. Categorical data are data that <strong>cannot be represented with numbers</strong> (or at least not in mathematical meaning) such as brands of cars, gender, yes or no answer etc. As its name suggests numerical data are numbers and in general <strong>any things that can be measured</strong>, such as height, weight, age and so on.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-08-12-types_of_data.JPG" width="100%" /></p>

<p>Quantitative data can additionally be divided into <strong>continuous</strong> and <strong>discrete</strong> data. In general we will say that discrete data can rather be <em>counted</em> than <em>measured</em>. A good example is number of children one has - it will definitely be <strong>an integer</strong> and there can only be some certain values like 0, 1, 2, … let’s say up to 15. Continuous data are measurements, for example person’s height, which can be <strong>represented on the real number line</strong> (it can take an infinite number of values).</p>

<p>Qualitative data can be split into <strong>nominal</strong> and <strong>ordinal</strong> data. Nominal values act as <strong>labels</strong> for variables with no quantitative value. For example if there was a dataset of different car brands we could <strong>encode</strong> them as BMW = 0, Mercedes = 1, Toyota = 2 and so on. Notice however that these numbers <strong>do not represent any order</strong>. In case of yes or no question it is also common to assign 0 or 1 values. Such feature is called <strong>dichotomous</strong> (<strong>binomial</strong>) - a categorical data type with only two possible categories. Ordinal values on the other hand represent <strong>discrete ordered units</strong>. Their use is <strong>common in surveys</strong> - for example level of satisfaction could be measured on a scale from 1 (not satisfied at all) to 10 (extremely satisfied).</p>

<p>There are four common ways to describe a set of observations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>measures of central tendency (location)</li>
  <li>measures of asymmetry</li>
  <li>measures of statistical dispersion (spread, scatter, variability)</li>
  <li>measures of statistical dependence (if more than one variable is measured)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="measures-of-central-tendency-mean-median-mode">Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, Mode</h1>

<p><strong>Measures of central tendency</strong> attempt to describe a dataset by identifying its central or <strong>typical value</strong>. Most popular measures are arithmetic mean (average), median and mode.</p>

<p>The <strong>arithmetic mean</strong> is equal to the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of these values. If there are <script type="math/tex">n</script> values in a dataset, then the sample mean formula is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\bar{x} = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_n}{n}</script>

<p>or equivalently:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">‎‎\bar{x} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n‎} x_i}{n}</script>

<p>Presented formula refers to the mean of a sample. It is important to be aware whether a statistic is calculated for a sample or for a population. If we had the entire population data, we would be 100% sure of the calculated measure, while <strong>the number calculated from a sample is an approximation of the population parameter</strong>. Some formulas are specially adjusted for calculation of the population statistic. In case of the mean, the formula for a population is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mu = \frac{x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_N}{N}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">‎‎\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i}{N}</script>

<p>Technically it is a different formula (it uses different notation), but the statistic is computed in the same way. Later we will see statistics that have different formulas and are computed in different ways.</p>

<p>One main disadvantage of the mean is that it is <strong>heavily affected by outliers</strong> (data points that significantly differ from other observations, i.e. are unusually small or large).</p>

<p>Second measure of central tendency is the <strong>median</strong>. To calculate the median we need to <strong>order the dataset in ascending order and take the value on the middle position</strong> (or a mean of values on two middle positions in case of even number of observations). Unlike the mean, the median is <strong>not affected by outliers</strong>.</p>

<p>The last popular measure is the <strong>mode</strong>. It is the value that occurs most often in a dataset. It is the only central tendency measure that can be used with nominal data.</p>

<p><em>There is no single rule as to when particular statistics should be used. If there are a lot of outliers in a dataset, the median or mode should be used (median usually preferred). Nominal data can have only a mode (and sometimes it doesn’t even have that). The mean is preferred when the data distribution is continuous and symmetrical.</em></p>

<h1 id="measures-of-asymmetry-skewness-and-kurtosis">Measures of Asymmetry: Skewness and Kurtosis</h1>

<p>The most common tool for measuring asymmetry is <strong>skewness</strong>. It is a <strong>degree of distortion from the normal distribution</strong>. Skewness basically says where the observations are concentrated.</p>

<p>The sample skewness formula is:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\frac{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^3}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i-\bar{x})^2}^3}</script>

<p>If the <strong>mean is greater than the median</strong> we say that the data is <strong>positively skewed</strong> or <strong>right-skewed</strong>. When we plot the distribution of such data, we can see that most observations are <strong>clustered around the left tail</strong> and <strong>the right tail is longer</strong>. The name of the skew may seem counterintuitive. Remember that this name does not indicate where the majority of observations are, but rather to which side the tail is leaning (on which side the outliers are).</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-08-12-measuring_data\output_2_1.png" width="60%" /></p>

<p>If the <strong>median is greater than the mean</strong> we say that the data is <strong>negatively skewed</strong> or <strong>left-skewed</strong>. When we plot the distribution of such data, we can see that most observations are <strong>clustered around the right tail</strong> and <strong>the left tail is longer</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-08-12-measuring_data\output_6_1.png" width="60%" /></p>

<p>In normally distributed data all measures of central tendency are equal. We say that there is no or zero skew.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-08-12-measuring_data\output_4_1.png" width="60%" /></p>

<p>The result of the skewness formula presented at the beginning of this section will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>zero for symmetrical distributions</li>
  <li>less than zero for left-skewed distributions</li>
  <li>greater than zero for right-skewed distributions</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also a rule according to which:</p>

<ul>
  <li>data with skewness between -0.5 and 0.5 are <strong>rather symmetrical</strong></li>
  <li>data with skewness between -1 and -0.5 (left-skewed) or 0.5 and 1 (right-skewed) are <strong>moderately skewed</strong></li>
  <li>data with skewness lower than -1 (left-skewed) or greater than 1 (right-skewed) are <strong>highly skewed</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Kurtosis</strong> is generally a measure of <strong>number of outliers</strong> in a distribution. Graphically various kurtosis types are represented by the <strong>thickness of distribution’s tails</strong> in relation to its overall shape. All kurtosis types are compared against a standard normal distribution.</p>

<p><strong>Normal distribution</strong> when graphed as a histogram is bell-shaped and has most of the data within <strong>+/- three standard deviations from the mean</strong>. This type of distribution is called <strong>mesokurtic</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-08-12-measuring_data\mesokurtic.png" width="65%" /></p>

<p><strong>High kurtosis</strong> indicates that there are <strong>a lot of outliers</strong> in the dataset.
This type of distribution is called <strong>leptokurtic</strong>. It’s usually identified by a thin and tall peak (however, it is important to remember that officially kurtosis is about tails, not about peaks!)</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-08-12-measuring_data\leptokurtic.png" width="65%" /></p>

<p>Finally, <strong>low kurtosis</strong> indicates that there are <strong>none or not many outliers</strong>. This type of distribution is called <strong>platykurtic</strong>. Oftentimes it has a lower peak that this of normal distribution.</p>

<p><img src="\assets\img\2019-08-12-measuring_data\platykurtic.png" width="65%" /></p>

<h1 id="measures-of-variability-variance-standard-deviation-coefficient-of-variation">Measures of Variability: Variance, Standard Deviation, Coefficient of Variation</h1>

<p>The <strong>variance</strong> measures the dispersion of data points around their mean value. For the population, it is equal to <strong>the sum of squared differences between the observed values and their mean divided by the total number of observations</strong>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sigma^2 = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i-\mu)^2}{N}</script>

<p>Sample variance however is computed in a slightly different way - the sum of squared differences is divided by the number of observations minus 1.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S^2 = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i-\bar x)^2}{n-1}</script>

<p>The closer to the mean our data points are, the smaller the differences will be, therefore the smaller variance. Taking the square value of the differences has two purposes. First of all, we will <strong>always get non-negative computations</strong> (variance is about the distance and intuitively the distance cannot be a negative value). Secondly, squaring <strong>amplifies the effect of large differences</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>standard deviation</strong> is a square root of the variance.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sigma = \sqrt{\sigma^2}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S = \sqrt{S^2}</script>

<p>Standard deviation is way more frequently used by data analysts. The reason is that its units are the same as the units of the underlying data (e.g. we talked about X standard deviations from the mean when kurtosis was presented). Variance is only useful thanks to its convenient mathematical formula and easy computation.</p>

<p>If we want to compare the variability of two separate datasets, the standard deviation is useless. Instead, we use the <strong>coefficient of  variation</strong> (or <strong>relative standard deviation</strong>). It is calculated by dividing the standard deviation of a dataset by its mean.</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">c_v = \frac{\sigma}{\mu}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat {c_v} = \frac{S}{\bar x}</script>

<p>The first column consists of some random prices in EUR. The second column consists of the same prices expressed in HUF (where exchange rate is 325,37 HUF for 1 EUR). Due to HUF values being larger in general, the mean, variance and standard deviations for these data points are much greater than those for EUR. However, the coefficient of variation is the same for both datasets! Knowing this, we can say that <strong>both datasets have the same variability</strong> (which was obviously expected).</p>

<h1 id="measures-of-dependence-covariance-and-correlation">Measures of Dependence: Covariance and Correlation</h1>

<p>Measures of dependence should be considered when we are working with more than one variable. We say that two variables are related when changes in one variable coexist with changes in the other variable. Such relationships can be <strong>positive</strong> - as one variable goes up, the other also goes up or <strong>negative</strong> - when one goes up, the other goes down. Bigger houses are more expensive (<em>positive relationship</em>). When prices of some goods go up, people tend to buy more of other (substitute) goods (<em>negative relationship</em>).</p>

<p>Relationships can be <strong>linear</strong> which means a straight line can be used to show the relationship between variables or <strong>nonlinear</strong>. <strong>Strong</strong> relationships can be described using relatively simple mathematical formulas, <strong>weak</strong> relationships might require more complicated ones.</p>

<p><strong>Covariance</strong> is the main statistic for measuring correlation between variables. It may be <strong>positive, negative</strong> or <strong>equal to zero</strong>. Sample and population formulas are as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">S_{xy} = \frac{\sum^n_{i=1}(x_i - \bar x)(y_i - \bar y)}{n-1}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\sigma_{xy} = \frac{\sum^N_{i=1}(x_i - \mu_x)(y_i - \mu_y)}{N}</script>

<p><strong>Covariance</strong> gives a sense of the direction:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>cov(x,y) &gt; 0</strong> means the two variables move in <strong>the same direction</strong></li>
  <li><strong>cov(x,y) &lt; 0</strong> means the two variables move in <strong>opposite directions</strong></li>
  <li><strong>cov(x,y) = 0</strong> means the variables are <strong>independent</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>It does not indicate the strength of the relationship between variables. For this, we have the <strong>correlation coefficient</strong>. Correlation adjusts covariance, so that the interpretation of relationship between variables becomes easy and intuitive. It is computed by dividing covariance by the product of standard deviations of the two variables. Formulas for the sample and the population are:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">r_{X,Y} = \frac{S_{xy}}{S_x S_y}</script>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{\sigma_{xy}}{\sigma_x \sigma_y}</script>

<p>Correlation values fall in the range of <script type="math/tex">[-1, 1]</script>. Correlation equal to <script type="math/tex">1</script> is known as a <strong>perfect positive correlation</strong>. In such case we say that the entire variability of one variable is explained by the other variable. Correlation of <script type="math/tex">0</script> means the two variables are absolutely <strong>independent</strong> from each other. Correlation of <script type="math/tex">-1</script> is called a <strong>perfect negative correlation</strong>.</p>

<p>If the correlation coefficient falls in the range of <script type="math/tex">(0,1)</script> we will say there is imperfect positive correlation and in the range of <script type="math/tex">(-1,0)</script> <script type="math/tex">-</script> imperfect negative correlation.</p>

<p>Both formulas, for the correlation and the covariance are <strong>symmetrical with respect to both variables</strong>, i.e. the correlation / covariance between variables <script type="math/tex">X</script> and <script type="math/tex">Y</script> is the same as the correlation / covariance between variables <script type="math/tex">Y</script> and <script type="math/tex">X</script>.</p>

<p>Finally, it is important to remember that <strong>the correlation does not imply causation</strong>. In causal relationships the change in one variable causes the change in the second variable, but the opposite is not true.</p>

<p>Presented measures are basic ones used in descriptive statistics. There are obviously more. However, mastering the use of what the article describes is already a pretty strong data analyst skill set.</p>

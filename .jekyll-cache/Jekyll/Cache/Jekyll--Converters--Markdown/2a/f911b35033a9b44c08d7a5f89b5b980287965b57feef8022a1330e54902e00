<p><strong>CTEs (Common Table Expressions)</strong> are specified using WITH clause with one or more comma-separated subclauses. Each subclause provides a subquery that produces a named result set. These named sets can then be used within a subsequent SELECT statement.</p>

<p>From Amazon Redshift documentation: WITH clause subqueries are an efficient way of defining tables that can be used throughout the execution of a single query. In all cases, the same results can be achieved by using subqueries in the main body of the SELECT statement, but WITH clause subqueries may be simpler to write and read. Where possible, WITH clause subqueries that are referenced multiple times are optimized as common subexpressions; that is, it may be possible to evaluate a WITH subquery once and reuse its results.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where <em>with_subquery</em> is:</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">with_subquery_table_name</span> <span class="p">[</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="k">column_name</span> <span class="p">[,</span> <span class="p">...]</span> <span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">]</span> <span class="k">AS</span> <span class="p">(</span> <span class="n">query</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The WITH clause is a tool for <strong>materializing subqueries</strong> to avoid having to recompute them multiple times. A CTE can be referenced multiple times in the same query and can also be self-referencing. Besides making the query execution faster, subquery factoring also makes complex queries easier to read (especially when we get rid of multiple chunks of identical subqueries). Defining more than one CTE within a WITH statement can help simplify very complicated queries which are ultimately joined together.</p>

<p>The CTE is not stored as an object and the result set exists only throughout the query execution (it has an execution scope of a <strong>single</strong> SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE statement and cannot be reused after). It can be treated as a substitute for a view if you do not have permissions to create a view object or just do not want to create it as it is only used once in your specific query.</p>

<h1 id="temporary-tables">Temporary Tables</h1>

<p><strong>Temporary Tables</strong> exist and hold data for the duration of a session and are automatically dropped at the end of it. Typically they are created so that they can be joined into a query later in the session.</p>

<p>A temporary table can have the same name as an existing permanent table (not recommended though). It is created in a separate, session-specific schema (schema name cannot be specified by a user). This schema then becomes the first schema in the search path, so the temporary table will take precedence over the permanent table unless you qualify the table name with the schema name to access the permanent table.</p>

<p>The syntax for creating a temporary table is the same as for permanent tables with additional TEMPORARY or TEMP keyword.</p>

<div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">CREATE</span> <span class="k">TEMPORARY</span> <span class="o">|</span> <span class="k">TEMP</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span>
<span class="p">...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Temporary tables are often used for <strong>staging</strong> raw or unprocessed data that will be used to make changes to the target table. They also allow for indexes and constraints which are not possible with CTEs.</p>

<h1 id="which-one-to-use">Which one to use?</h1>

<p>It seems there is no straightforward answer to this questionâ€¦ However <a href="https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/13112/whats-the-difference-between-a-cte-and-a-temp-table/13117#13117">here</a> I found an interesting discussion outlining pros and cons of both.</p>
